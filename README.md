# Project Title: Applied Privacy Lite

![Output](https://github.com/Spartan-119/applied-privacy-lite/compressed_output_gif.gif)

## Overview

Applied Privacy Lite is an open-source initiative dedicated to fortifying data privacy through a two-phase approach. The first phase involves implementing a robust privacy layer using advanced transformers in natural language processing (NLP) for the identification and extraction of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from textual data. In the second phase, the focus shifts to incorporating federated learning, allowing the model to learn across decentralized devices while prioritizing user privacy.

## Features

### Phase 1: Privacy Layer Implementation

- **PII Identification:** Employ cutting-edge transformers in NLP for the effective identification and extraction of PIIs from textual data.
- **Anonymization:** Implement mechanisms to anonymize sensitive information, ensuring the privacy of user data.

### Phase 2: Federated Learning

- **Decentralized Learning:** Enable federated learning to train models across distributed devices without compromising user data.
- **Privacy-Preserving Training:** Implement techniques to maintain the privacy of individual data during the federated learning process.
